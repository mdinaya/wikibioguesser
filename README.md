## Setup and Run Locally

Follow these steps to get your own WikiBio Guesser running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` 

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdinaya/wikibioguesser.git
    cd wikibioguesser
    
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the App

1.  **Prepare the `names.json` file:**
    This project relies on a `names.json` file containing a list of Wikipedia article titles (e.g., famous people, places, concepts) that the game will use.
    * Create a file named `names.json` in the root directory of your project.
    * Populate it with a JSON array of strings. Each string should be an exact Wikipedia article title.
    * **Example `names.json` content:**
        ```json
        [
            "Albert Einstein",
            "Marie Curie",
            "Leonardo da Vinci",
            "Queen Elizabeth II",
            "Nelson Mandela"
        ]
        ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open to the app (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Project Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py           # The main Streamlit application script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ names.json       # (You need to create this) A list of Wikipedia titles for the game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.py          # The script to get the names from the HF database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # This README file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt # (You'll generate this) Python dependencies
```
